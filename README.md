# CosmosDbSubCollections

Scaffolding to support sub-collections in Azure Cosmos DB. Sub-collections can enable cost reductions, particularly for small deployments with small Azure Cosmos DB provisioned throughput.

This repo contains sample code for my article `Azure Cosmos DB like a pro (minimize cost, maximize productivity)`.
